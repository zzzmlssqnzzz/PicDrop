# PicDrop

PicDrop displays the basic properties of images that are dragged, dropped, or uploaded by users. To view these properties, simply hover over the info icon. Additionally, users can reset the screen to return to its original state. PicDrop supports image files up to 10 MB in size. For testing purposes, you can use the provided sample images to ensure everything is functioning correctly

# To run locally

Firstly, ensure that npm is installed. To do so, you can run the following command in your terminal to check.

`npm -v`

If it returns command not found, you can install npm
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

Once you have installed npm, run the following steps:

1. Enter the picdrop folder.

   `cd picdrop`

2. Install the dependencies.

   `npm i`

3. Run locally.

   `npm start`

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
